ETL and SQL Analysis on Energy Dataset
Project Description
This project is a Jupyter Notebook that performs an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process and SQL analysis on a global energy dataset. The workflow includes:

Extract: Loading raw energy data from sources covering 2000 to 2020.
Transform: Cleaning and processing the data to ensure consistency and usability.
Load: Storing the processed data into a SQLite database.
Analysis: Conducting SQL queries to explore:
Total energy consumption trends.
Greenhouse gas emissions.
Per capita energy usage across regions.


Visualization: Generating insightful charts and graphs to highlight key trends and findings.
