# ETL-and-SQL-Analysis-on-Energy-Dataset

Description
This project is a Jupyter Notebook that performs an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and SQL analysis on a global energy dataset. It cleans and processes the data, loads it into a SQLite database, and conducts queries to analyze total energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and per capita energy trends from 2000 to 2020, with visualizations to highlight key insights.
